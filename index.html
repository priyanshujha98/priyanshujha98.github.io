  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I'm a passionate Software Engineer and Cloud Developer with over 4 years of experience designing and deploying modern applications in both startup and freelance environments. I specialize in building scalable, secure, and efficient cloud-native solutions using technologies like AWS, Terraform, Node.js, Python, and React.js. I’ve led projects ranging from tax automation platforms to multi-tenant cloud applications, serving industries such as fintech, e-commerce, consulting, and real estate.
  </p>
  <p>
    With a strong academic foundation in Data Science and Information Technology, I bring both depth and versatility to my work. My Master's dissertation explored NLP-based recommendation systems for cloud services, while my Bachelor's included smart traffic systems using YOLO object detection. In addition to my full-time roles, I’ve worked with clients globally through Upwork, delivering fullstack and DevOps projects across diverse domains. My goal is to create meaningful tech that drives value and scales with business needs.
